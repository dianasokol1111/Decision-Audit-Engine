  <h1>Decision Audit Engine — Executive Edition</h1>

<p>
Decision Audit Engine is an executive decision analysis tool that converts uncertainty,
projected outcomes, and decision pressure into a clear numerical argument.
</p>

<p>
It structures risk and loss across alternative actions, enabling decision-makers
to assess exposure before committing capital, reputation, or time.
</p>

<p>
The system does not make decisions.
It does not provide advice.
It identifies whether a numerical commitment trigger is present.
</p>

<p><em>
Responsibility remains entirely with the decision-holder.
</em></p>
