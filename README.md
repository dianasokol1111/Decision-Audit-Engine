# Decision Audit Engine™

Decision Audit Engine helps you pause before reacting to pressure.

It shows whether the urgency you feel is caused by time —  
or by fear of loss.

This is not a decision-making tool.
It is a clarity tool for moments of high-stakes uncertainty.

## Who this is for

- Founders facing high-pressure decisions
- Executives under time constraints
- Investors weighing delayed vs immediate action
- Anyone who feels forced to decide “now” without clarity
This is an experimental system.
It does not predict outcomes or provide recommendations.
Early access (€59) includes:
- live use of the engine
- full dynamic interpretation
- unlimited single-decision audits
