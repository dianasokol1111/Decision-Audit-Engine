# Decision Audit Engine™

Decision Audit Engine helps you pause before reacting to pressure.

It shows whether the urgency you feel is caused by time —  
or by fear of loss.

This is not a decision-making tool.  
It is a clarity tool for moments of high-stakes uncertainty.

👉 **Paid access (€59)** — purchase link below in the *Access* section.

## Who this is for

- Founders facing high-pressure decisions  
- Executives under time constraints  
- Investors weighing delayed vs immediate action  
- Anyone who feels forced to decide “now” without clarity  

---

## What this tool does

Decision Audit Engine examines the relationship between:

- perceived potential loss  
- time remaining  
- the pressure you feel to act  

It helps separate **structural urgency** from **psychological pressure**.

This system does not predict outcomes.  
It does not provide recommendations.
